`Aesthete` is a Swift package that provides utilities to assist in working with various aesthetic concepts, such as visual forms and color schemes.

## Features

- A new type of color representation object (`HSBAColor`) that works across platforms, unifies the other color types, and is `Codable` and `Hashable`
- A representation type for related groups of colors (`ColorScheme`) and its many extensions to make it simple to create visually-pleasing color schemes
- Data objects for working with visual forms, including those that repeat along a line (`RepeatableLinearForm`)  and those that are used to represent both symmetrical and asymetrical symbols (`SymbolicForm`)
- Data objects to ease the process of working with sections of paths that need to be independently stored, modified, or repeated (`Pathlet`)
- Various extensions to standard datatypes to enhance their functionality
