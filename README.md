Aesthete is a Swift package that provides utilities to assist with various aesthetic concepts, such as visual forms and color schemes.

Though the functionality provided is driven by the specific needs of Dunesailer Research itself, we believe there is value to the broader programmming public contained therein, so we are pleased to make these available in a free and open source format.
